# GPU Programming 

A transistor is a device that can increase the strength of an electronic signal or that can control the flow of the current. 

An integrated circuit (IC) is a mini electronic circuit. It combines transistors, resistors, capacitors, inductors into a single and small chip. 

We can control the software cost by redesigning the software less. But how we can avoid redesigning the software more ? 

Well, we can make the application scalable and portable. But what do we mean by scalability and portability ? Scalability is the ability of the application to handle large amounts of workloads by taking advantage of additional computing resources. Portability, on the other hand, is the ability for the application to run on multiple computing environments with minimal modifications.

So, how we can make the application scalable ? 

- More cores
- More threads per core
- More memory
- Faster interconnect

And how can we make the application portable ? 

- Supporting different instruction sets.
- Adapting to various processing units.
- Handling different memory architectures.

Heterogeneous parallel programming means developing software that can use multiple processing units simultaneously to take advantage of their unique strengths. But might be these processing units ?

- CPUs (Central Processing Units)
- GPUs (Graphics Processing Units)
- FPGAs (Field-Programmable Gate Arrays)
- DSPs (Digital Signal Sensors)
- AI Accelerators (e.g., Tensor Processing Units)
